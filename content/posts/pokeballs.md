Pokeballs made using Signed Distance Fields, implementing realtime PBR, Environment Mapping, Raymarching & Subsurface Scattering.

<!--more-->

In this C++/OpenGL project, I created Pokeballs using Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) and also implemented the realtime PBR pipeline based on the paper [Real Shading in Unreal Engine 4](https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/Resources/files/2013SiggraphPresentationsNotes-26915738.pdf). Some basic Qt tooling allows an interactive program like the following:

### The PBR Pipeline consists of:

1. Cook-Torrance Microfacet Specular BRDF:
   - GGX/Trowbridge-Reitz Distribution Function
   - Schlick Model for Geometric Attenuation
   - Schlickâ€™s Approximation for Fresnel
2. Image-based Lighting
   - Environment Map Sampling
   - Precomputed Diffuse & Specular Reflections
   - Mipmapping to avoid artifacts

### The SDF implementation comprises of:
1. Raymarching
2. 3 different SDFs for Normal Ball, Great Ball, Ultra Ball
3. Normal computation for SDFs
4. Domain Repetition based on [this](https://iquilezles.org/articles/distfunctions/) article from Inigo Quilez
5. Perlin Noise for adding rotational variation


Here are some fun renders with different types of Pokeballs, environment maps, and roughness/metallic settings, along with some grid-baed repetition:
